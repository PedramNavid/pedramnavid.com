Welcome to Pedram's Web Blog.               

Here, I capture small TILs (Today I Learned) snippets. Inspired by [Simon Willison](https://til.simonwillison.net/). 

I work at [Dagster](https://dagster.io) where I work on open-source tooling.

I wrote a Neovim Plugin for dbt called [dbtpal](https://github.com/PedramNavid/dbtpal). 

I have an unfinished book called [Rust for Data](https://github.com/PedramNavid/rust-for-data) that I
may one day pickup again.
