No boilerplate, no fluff, just the essentials. Here's the correct way to 
use Python virtual environments. My way. No other way is good. Don't think 
about doing it any other way.

1. Install pyenv and pyenv-virtualenv

```bash
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv.git $(pyenv root)/plugins/pyenv-virtualenv
```

2. Add environment variables to your startup files. This is for zsh.

```bash
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo '[[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

3. Install a Python version you care about 

```bash
pyenv 3.11
```

4. Create a virtual environment

```bash
pyenv virtualenv 3.11 myenv
```

5. Activate the virtual environment and set it to always run from this folder
```bash
mkdir my-python-project
pyenv local myenv
```


That's it. Never think about Python environments again.
